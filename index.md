Stanford Middle East Ensemble
=============================

We are Stanford University's ensemble for music from across the Middle East region, with a focus on Arabic, Turkish, and Persian music. We perform regularly both on and off campus.

Our membership is open and consists of undergrads, grad students, staff, and faculty, as well as members of the broader community. All are welcome, regardless of background or prior experience.


### Activities

We typically hold weekly open rehearsals and drink tea together during term time on the Stanford campus. For the time being, we are not holding in-person events, and we periodically hold remote rehearsals and get-togethers. Please be in touch (below) if you're interested in our group!
